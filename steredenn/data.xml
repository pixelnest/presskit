		STEREDENN is a frenetic space shooter, carved in big beautiful pixels. Embark in your ship and engage the fight against dreadful space pirates in a never-ending run to make the biggest score! In STEREDENN, each new enemy you will encounter is bigger and stronger than the previous ones. But, fear not! Your weapons are as equally sized.

		LAUNCH. ENGAGE. CRUSH!

	<history>
		After the SHMUPFEST and BULLETML FOR UNITY, the conclusion of this chapter for Pixelnest was to create a full-featured space shooter. For some times, Pixelnest was in discussion with Simon Coroller to band together to create a pixel-art game. The love of spaceships and pirates converged, and thus, STEREDENN was born. This new game continues where the SHMUPFEST was left. But even if the two share the same roots, STEREDENN takes it to a whole new level of fun and awesomeness, with a distinctive arena-like scoring system.
