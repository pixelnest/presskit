	<description>
		STEREDENN is a frenetic and chaotic space shooter, carved in big beautiful pixels with insane boss battles. Embark in your ship and engage the fight against dreadful space pirates in a never-ending combat for your survival. The game is fast, addictive, hard and action-packed.
	</description>

	<history>
		STEREDENN is at the crossroads between a shmup and a roguelike. The gameplay is infinite and unforgiving. The levels are (almost)-randomly generated, with a lot of different and completely unpredictable events (asteroid fields, laser rains, meteor showers, an old battlefield, labyrinths of lasers, etc.). Boss fights are hard, intense and epic. And each time you defeat one of those, you can upgrade your ship to unlock new powers and abilities.

		Grab your guns and go kick those big-badass-bosses you'll definitely encounter. Forge your own path across the universe. Good luck.

			<description>Overall, Steredenn is a unique twist on a long-lost arcade classic, the side-scrolling shmup of ye olden times. It throws in some creative use of procedural generation and bombastic soundtrack and doesn’t shy away from offering the player repeat playthroughs.</description>
