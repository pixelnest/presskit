		SUPERMASSIVE is a frenetic space shooter, carved in big beautiful pixels. Embark in your ship and engage the fight against dreadful space pirates in an never-ending run to make the biggest score! In SUPERMASSIVE, each new enemy you will encounter is bigger and better than the previous ones. But, fear not! Your weapons are as equally sized.

		LAUNCH. ENGAGE. CRUSH!

	<history>
		After the SHMUPFEST and BULLETML FOR UNITY, the conclusion for Pixelnest was to create a full-featured space shooter. For some times, Pixelnest was in discussion with Simon Coroller to band together to create a pixel-art game. The love of spaceships and pirates converged, and thus, SUPERMASSIVE was born.
