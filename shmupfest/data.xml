			<header>Original idea</header>
			<text>
				3 Hit Combo, the association in charge of the Stunfest, imagined a game for its festival and offered Pixelnest Studio the opportunity to make it. Their request was either a "Shoot Them Up" (shmup) or a "Versus Fighting" game (they decided to go the shmup way), with a retro feeling and big pixels. The small twist was that the sprites were designed by the Ulule's backers. Most of the pledges of the crowdfunding campaign were offering a sprite in the game. And the more money one donates to the festival, the bigger the sprite was.

				Pixelnest Studio started the work on the shmup and a sprite editor. A month or two before the festival, the Sprite Editor was launched and the backers started (massively) to draw their own sprites. The result is more than 200 participations to the game art.

				The game was a hit during the festival, with a queue of people waiting to play the game almost all the time. It was also playable in front of the festival's main entry, on a giant big screen.
