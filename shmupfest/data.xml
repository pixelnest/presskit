	<description>
		The Shmupfest is a game we made for the Stunfest 2014, a french video game festival based in Rennes. It's an infinite retro 2D Shoot'Em Up, created with Unity 3D.
	</description>

	<history>
		3 Hit Combo, the association in charge of the Stunfest festival, imagined the game and offered us to make it for them. Their request was a Shoot Them Up game, with a retro feeling and big pixels, and with sprites designed by the Ulule's backers. Most pledges of the crowdfunding campaign were offering a sprite in the game, the more money you give the bigger your sprite is.
